 the step-by-step process I followed to complete this project:

2️⃣Next, Once I had the dataset accessible, I explored and analyzed it thoroughly, gaining valuable insights into the sales data.
3️⃣ Armed with insights, I commenced the process of visualizing the data using Power BI. I employed various techniques and visualization tools to create an interactive and informative sales dashboard.
4️⃣ As I progressed, I ensured the accuracy and integrity of the data by cleaning and transforming it, making it suitable for visualization.
5️⃣ I then carefully selected the most relevant KPIs and created visually appealing charts, graphs, and other visualizations to present the sales data effectively.
